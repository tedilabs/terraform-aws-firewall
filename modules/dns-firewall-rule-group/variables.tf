  (Optional) The rules that you define for the firewall rule group determine the filtering behavior. Each rule consists of a priority, a domain list, and action. Each item of `rules` block as defined below.
    (Required) `priority` - Determine the processing order of the rule in the rule group. DNS Firewall processes the rules in a rule group by order of priority, starting from the lowest priority.
    (Required) `name` - A name that lets you identify the rule.
    (Optional) `description` - The description of the rule.
    (Required) `domain_list` - The ID of the domain list that you want to use in the rule.
    (Required) `action` - The action that DNS Firewall should take on a DNS query when it matches one of the domains in the rule's domain list. Valid values are `ALLOW`, `BLOCK`, `ALERT`.
    (Optional) `action_parameters` - The configuration block for the parameters of the rule action. Only required with `BLOCK` action. `action_parameters` block as defined below.
      (Required) `response` - The way that you want DNS Firewall to block the request. Valid values are `NODATA`, `NXDOMAIN`, `OVERRIDE`. `NODATA` indicates that this query was successful, but there is no response available for the query. `NXDOMAIN` indicates that the domain name that's in the query doesn't exist. `OVERRIDE` provides a custom override response to the query.
      (Optional) `override` - The configuration for a custom override response to the query. Only required with `OVERRIDE` block response.
        (Required) `type` - The DNS record's type. This determines the format of the record value that you provided in BlockOverrideDomain. Value values are `CNAME`.
        (Required) `value` - The custom DNS record to send back in response to the query.
        (Required) `ttl` - The recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver or web browser to cache the provided override record. Minimum value of `0`. Maximum value of `604800`.
